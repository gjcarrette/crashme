NAME
       pddet - survey of procedure and descriptor usage

DESCRIPTION
       pddet  Survey  of  Procedure  Descriptor Usage. The emphasis here is on
       currently shipping  products.  The  program  pddet  included  with  the
       crashme distribution can be used to determine some of this information.
       Note that in some environments, e.g. Microsoft C++ 4.0 the  results  of
       pddet  will  be  different  depending  on the compilation modes chosen:
       debug versus release.
