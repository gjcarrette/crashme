NAME
       crashme - test operating environment software robustness

SYNOPSIS
       crashme [NBYTES] [SRAND] [NTRYS] [NSUB] [VERBOSE]

DESCRIPTION
       crashme is a very simple program that tests the operating environment's
       robustness by invoking random data as if  it  were  a  procedure.   The
       standard  signals  are  caught and handled with a setjmp back to a loop
       which will try again to produce a fault by executing random data.  Some
       people call this stress testing.


   COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       [NBYTES]
               The  [NBYTES]  should be an integer, specifying the size of the
               random data string in bytes. If given negative then  the  bytes
               are  printed  instead  of  being  executed.  If  given  with an
               explicit plus sign then the storage for the  bytes  is  freshly
               malloc'ed  each  time. This can have an effect on machines with
               separate I and D cache mechanisms. The argument can also have a
               dot  in  it,  X.Y, in which case Y is a increment for a pointer
               into the random data. The buffer is recalculated only when  the
               pointer gets near the end of the data.

               The are two magic values for [NBYTES] : A value of 81920 avoids
               malloc and returns a pointer to static  data.  This  makes  the
               operation  of  crashme  more  repeatable on architectures where
               malloc is designed to return unpredictable locations.  A  value
               of  1025  avoids a call that sets the protection of the data to
               READ+WRITE+EXEC.


       [SRAND] The [SRAND] is an input seed to the  random  number  generator,
               passed to srand.

       [NTRIES]
               The  [NTRIES] is how many times to loop before exiting normally
               from the program.

       [NSUB]  The [NSUB] is optional, the number of vfork  subprocesses  run‐
               ning  all at once.  If negative run one after another. If given
               as a time hrs:mns:scs (hours, minutes, seconds) then  one  sub‐
               process  will  be run to completion, followed by another, until
               the time limit has been reached.  If this argument is given  as
               the empty string or . then it is ignored.

               When  in  sequential-subprocess  mode there is a 30 second time
               limit on each subprocess. This is to allow the instruction-set-
               space random walk to continue when a process bashes itself into
               an infinite loop.  For example, the ntrys can be  bashed  to  a
               very  large number with nbytes bashed to zero. (10 second limit
               on Windows NT).

               The SRAND argument is incremented by one for each subprocess.


       [VERBOSE]
               The [VERBOSE] arg is optional. 0 is the least  verbose,  5  the
               most.


EXAMPLE
       This is a suggested test, to run it for a least an hour.

FILES

DIAGNOSTICS
       When  a  signal  is caught the number and nature of the signal is indi‐
       cated.  Setting the environment variable CRASHLOG will cause each  sub‐
       process to record the arguments it was given.

BUGS
       Not  all  signals are caught, and the state of the user program/process
       environment can be sufficiently damaged such that  the  program  termi‐
       nates before going through all [NTRIES] operations.

       If  the architecture uses some kind of procedure descriptor but no spe‐
       cial code has been not been added to castaway() in crashme.c  then  the
       stress test will not be as potent as it would otherwise be.

       Beware: This program can crash your computer if the operating system or
       hardware of same is buggy. User data may be lost.
